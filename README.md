# Graph Rotator
This tool can be used to rotate any graph on Desmos (and most other software) by a certain angle.

# How to use:
1) Go on Desmos and create a new slider for variable "a" that ranges from 0 to 2pi. (You don't need to type the pi symbol just type "pi")

2) Go on the app.
3) If you have the graph equation copied, just click "Convert Clipboard". Otherwise, type the equation in the textbox and click "Convert Text".

4) Click "OK" in the popup window.
5) The rotatable graph equation is now in your clipboard.
6) Go on Desmos again.
7) Paste the equation into a new item.
8) And you are done! You can now use the slider to rotate the graph at any angle.

# Tips and Tricks:
1) Always use parenthesis in functions. (type "cos(2x)" instead of "cos2x")
2) Include what the expression should be equal to (even if its just y) at the end of equations. (type "4x + 3 = y" instead of "4x + 3")
3) Not following these tips might cause the app to work incorrectly.

# Be Aware:
I'm not a good mathematician nor a good programmer so the app might have some bugs.
